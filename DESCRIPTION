Description: The package contains only one function (size.matur), which is used to estimate the size at first maturity of a given species, given a percentage of the population (usually 50%, L50) that is of interest to the user. The function fits a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) from the mgcv package, and it returns the estimated size at first maturity with associated 95% confidence intervals.
